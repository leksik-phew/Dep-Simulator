# Small Dep Simulator
It is written in HTML, CSS, JS, and Electron JS. It is also built using Electron JS. I couldn't add all the files to the repository due to the size limit, so here's a step-by-step installation guide:

1. Create a directory
```
mkdir really_dep && cd really_dep
npm init -y
npm install electron
npm install --save-dev electron
npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli
```
2. Copy the code to the appropriate files( package.json, main.js and others)
3. Use it!
